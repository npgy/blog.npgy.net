# NPGY's Blog
This is an in-progress home for my blog which can be accessed at https://blog.npgy.net

Currently it is automatically deployed to Cloudflare Pages.  
It seems to be quite fast!


### Installation

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
